# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the TypeScript compilation errors occurring when using Supabase generated types with query methods in Formula PM V3. The project currently fails to build due to strict type checking conflicts between Supabase's generated generic types and standard TypeScript string parameters used in database queries. The solution must maintain type safety while enabling successful compilation and deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Supabase query methods (.eq(), .neq(), etc.) without TypeScript compilation errors, so that the project can build successfully for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using .eq() method with string parameters THEN TypeScript SHALL compile without type mismatch errors
2. WHEN using .neq() method with string parameters THEN TypeScript SHALL compile without type mismatch errors  
3. WHEN using other Supabase filter methods THEN TypeScript SHALL compile without generic type conflicts
4. WHEN running npm run build THEN the build SHALL complete successfully without TypeScript errors
5. IF using type assertions THEN they SHALL be minimal and maintain meaningful type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for database schema fields, so that I can work with consistent data structures throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing user profile data THEN the system SHALL provide full_name field instead of separate first_name/last_name
2. WHEN working with permissions data THEN the system SHALL handle Permission[] type instead of string[] | null
3. WHEN querying database tables THEN type definitions SHALL match the actual application data model
4. IF database schema differs from application model THEN transformation utilities SHALL be provided
5. WHEN using generated types THEN they SHALL be wrapped with application-specific type definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured Supabase client with correct TypeScript types, so that all database operations are type-safe and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing Supabase client THEN it SHALL use the correct Database type definitions
2. WHEN performing database queries THEN the client SHALL provide proper IntelliSense and type checking
3. WHEN using table-specific operations THEN type safety SHALL be maintained without excessive type assertions
4. IF generic types are too complex THEN simplified type aliases SHALL be created for common operations
5. WHEN importing database types THEN they SHALL be properly exported and accessible throughout the application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing application functionality to remain unchanged, so that the type fixes don't break any current features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing type fixes THEN all existing database queries SHALL continue to work correctly
2. WHEN updating type definitions THEN application logic SHALL remain functionally identical
3. WHEN modifying Supabase client configuration THEN all current features SHALL maintain their behavior
4. IF type changes affect data transformation THEN backward compatibility SHALL be ensured
5. WHEN deploying type fixes THEN the application SHALL function identically to the current development version
