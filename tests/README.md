## Test Configuration

The tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts` with:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Browsers**: Chromium (primary), Firefox, Webkit
- **Timeouts**: Extended for slower loading pages
- **Screenshots**: On failure only
- **Videos**: On failure only
- **Traces**: On first retry

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npm run playwright:install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/auth-flow.spec.ts

# Run tests with specific options
npx playwright test --workers=1 --timeout=90000
```

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Passing Tests
- **Basic Smoke Tests**: All 3 tests passed
  - Homepage loading ‚úÖ
  - Login page loading ‚úÖ
  - Login attempt with credentials ‚úÖ

- **Authentication Flow Tests**: All 3 tests passed  
  - Complete authentication flow ‚úÖ
  - Invalid credentials handling ‚úÖ
  - Mobile responsiveness ‚úÖ

- **Dashboard Functionality**: 4/6 tests passed
  - Dashboard display after login ‚úÖ
  - Navigation within dashboard ‚úÖ
  - Authentication state persistence ‚úÖ
  - Mobile responsiveness ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Attention

1. **Loading Performance**: 
   - Pages take 10-20+ seconds to load during tests
   - May indicate environment setup or performance optimization needs

2. **Test Selector Robustness**:
   - Some selectors are too strict (resolved to 2 elements error)
   - Network offline simulation needs API update

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

1. **Authentication System**: 
   - Login with provided credentials works perfectly
   - Redirects to dashboard as expected
   - Session persistence across page reloads

2. **Basic Functionality**:
   - All core pages load successfully
   - Form interactions work correctly
   - Mobile responsiveness is good

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid credentials are handled gracefully
   - Application remains stable during edge cases

### üîç Observed Behavior

1. **User Flow**: 
   - Homepage ‚Üí Login button ‚Üí Login form ‚Üí Dashboard (successful)
   - Authentication persists after browser refresh
   - Mobile viewport works without horizontal scroll

2. **Performance**:
   - Initial page loads are slow but functional
   - Once loaded, navigation is smooth
   - No critical errors or crashes observed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Performance Investigation**:
   - Profile page loading times
   - Optimize initial bundle size
   - Review database query performance

2. **Test Reliability**:
   - Update selectors to be more resilient
   - Add proper wait strategies for dynamic content
   - Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests

3. **Extended Coverage**:
   - Add API endpoint testing
   - Include database state verification
   - Test offline/poor connectivity scenarios

### Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Add screenshot comparison tests
   - Verify UI consistency across browsers

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test with real data scenarios
   - Multi-user concurrent testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility validation

## Test Environment

- **Node.js**: Latest LTS
- **Playwright**: v1.54.2
- **Browser**: Chromium (primary testing)
- **Application**: Next.js 15.4.6
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:3000
