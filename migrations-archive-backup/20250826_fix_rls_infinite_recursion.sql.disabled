-- Fix infinite recursion in project_members RLS policies
-- This migration resolves circular dependency between projects and project_members tables

-- First, drop the problematic policies that cause infinite recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS users_view_project_members ON project_members;

-- Create a simplified policy without self-referential recursion
-- This policy allows users to view project_members if:
-- 1. They are the user in the project_members row
-- 2. They are the creator or manager of the project
-- 3. They have admin permissions
CREATE POLICY users_view_project_members ON project_members
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  -- Allow users to see their own membership records
  user_id = auth.uid() 
  
  -- Allow project creators and managers to see all members of their projects
  OR project_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM projects 
    WHERE created_by = auth.uid() 
       OR project_manager = auth.uid()
  )
  
  -- Allow users with admin permissions to see all project members
  OR EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
      AND ('view_all_projects' = ANY(permissions) 
           OR 'manage_all_users' = ANY(permissions))
  )
);

-- Add helpful comment
COMMENT ON POLICY users_view_project_members ON project_members IS 
  'Simplified policy to prevent infinite recursion. Users can view project members if they are the member, project owner/manager, or have admin permissions.';
