-- FORMULA PM V3 - COMPLETE RLS SECURITY FIX
-- Date: 2025-08-20
-- Purpose: Implement proper RLS security with simple, non-recursive policies
--          This is the definitive security migration for Formula PM V3
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: CLEAN SLATE - DROP ALL EXISTING POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

DECLARE
    policy_record RECORD;
    table_record RECORD;
    table_name TEXT;

        END;
    END LOOP;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'âœ… All policies dropped and RLS disabled on existing tables';
END $$;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: ENABLE RLS ON SECURITY-CRITICAL TABLES
-- ============================================================================

-- High security tables that need RLS
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE project_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE scope_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE shop_drawings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE material_specs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE rfis ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE change_orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE punch_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Tables that can remain without RLS (low risk, public data)
-- companies, activity_logs, subcontractors stay DISABLED
